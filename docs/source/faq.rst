Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)
================================

**Q1: What is BioNeuralNet?**

A1: BioNeuralNet is a Python package designed to integrate omics data with neural network embeddings, facilitating advanced data analysis in bioinformatics.

**Q2: How do I choose between SmCCNet and WGCNA for generating adjacency matrices?**

A2: Both SmCCNet and WGCNA are used for generating adjacency matrices from omics data. SmCCNet focuses on sparse canonical correlation analysis, while WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis) is widely used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes. Choose based on your specific analysis needs and familiarity.

**Q3: Can I use BioNeuralNet with GPU acceleration?**

A3: Yes, BioNeuralNet supports CUDA-enabled installations for GPU acceleration. Ensure that your system has a compatible NVIDIA GPU and the appropriate CUDA version installed.

**Q4: How do I contribute to BioNeuralNet?**

A4: Contributions are welcome! Please refer to the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to contribute.

**Q5: Where can I report bugs or request features?**

A5: You can report bugs or request features by opening an issue on our [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/https://github.com/UCD-BDLab/BioNeuralNet/issues) page.
