**Hybrid Example 1 (SmCCNet + GNN Embeddings + Subject Representation):**  
Shows how to construct a network using SmCCNet, generate embeddings with a GNN, and 
integrate them into subject-level data.

**Hybrid Example 2 (WGCNA + GNN Embeddings + Subject Representation):**  
Illustrates using WGCNA-based networks, followed by GNN embedding and subject representation enhancements.

**Hybrid Example 3 (SmCCNet + DPMON)**  
Demonstrates how to generate a network with SmCCNet and then use DPMON for disease prediction.

By following these tutorials, you can gain insight into how BioNeuralNetâ€™s modules interoperate 
to produce meaningful multi-omics analyses and ready-to-use data for downstream tasks such as disease 
prediction or feature selection.
